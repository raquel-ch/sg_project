Expert Witness (MSN Music),91,"Even in their overwork, however, they evince an effort that bears a remarkable resemblance to care‑-that is, to caring in the best, broadest, and most emotional sense."
Entertainment Weekly,83,"Beneath Swift's not-a-girl, not-yet-a-woman sweetness lurks a rigorous and very skillful technique; love may confound her, but the art of expert songcraft clearly doesn't."
The Guardian,80,"At times the self-consciousness of an artist forcing herself into new modes shows – but mostly, Speak Now is a triumph."
PopMatters,80,"All of Speak Now engages in that act of making our story hers, and her story ours, which is what pop stars do well."
Hartford Courant,80,"It's provided great fodder as devotees of celebrity gossip speculate on who, exactly, she's singing about, but with Swift's endearing appeal as a singer and ever-growing skill as a songwriter, Speak Now makes for great listening, too."
Rolling Stone,80,"She's in a class by herself when it comes to turning all that romantic turmoil into great songs. At this point, she's like the new Morrissey, except with even more eyeliner."
Sputnikmusic,80,"Swift still prefers to write about her own broken love stories, the production is still a glossy pop-rock with only the faintest of country tinge to harken back to her roots, and Swift herself is still as dead-to-rights honest as she's always been."
AllMusic,80,"She may be not a girl, and not yet a woman, but on Speak Now she captures that transition with a personal grace and skill that few singer/songwriters have."
Los Angeles Times,75,"Swift's ability to articulate her vision is growing beautifully. Next, one hopes, she'll turn off that night light and confront the realities that remain, for her, in the dark."
Paste Magazine,71,"Speak Now solidifies Swift as a pop star in her own right. She may not have the edge of Lady Gaga or the sex appeal of a young Britney, but, much like Beyonce, she does want someone to put a ring on it-even if that does mean meeting her dad and promising you'll love her forever."
Country Weekly,70,"While Taylor turns her wrath on a woman who steals her man on ""Better Than Revenge,"" she turns that critical eye on herself in ""Back to December,"" a thorough apology to a former lover she regrets having left behind. Other tunes, such as ""Mean"" and ""Sparks Fly,"" suffer from generic and sometimes underdeveloped lyrics."
American Songwriter,70,"Because of the buzz behind it, Speak Now was destined to be a commercial success no matter what. Thankfully, the album succeeds on an artistic level as well."
Village Voice,70,"She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's learned how to make words sound like what they mean."
Sputnikmusic,70,"The focus should be that after everything that's happened with her career, I can still listen to a record as uneven as Speak Now and feel like Taylor Swift is somebody I could fall in love with given the chance."
BBC Music,70,"With some judicious – let's have it then – tailoring, this is a sparky and affecting record, moving Swift on at a stately and assured pace."
Spin,70,Let's have a toast for the ladies who stick it to the douchebags.
The A.V. Club,67,Swift's niftiest trick is being at her most likeable when she's indulging in such overt nastiness.
Dot Music,60,Swift's thoughtful honesty and surprisingly articulate take on life should be commended.
Slant Magazine,60,"Speak Now is no pop masterpiece, though it's sure to be hailed as such in some circles."
NOW Magazine,40,"Celebrity aside, Speak Now is as hooky as its predecessors but differs in its often angry, spiteful tone."
