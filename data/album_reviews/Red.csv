Expert Witness (MSN Music),91,"I like the feisty ones, as I generally do. But ""Begin Again"" and especially ""Stay Stay Stay"" stay happy and hit just as hard."
Billboard.com,86,"Red is her most interesting full-length to date, but it probably won't be when all is said and done in her career."
Absolute Punk (Staff reviews),85,"It's sexy, daring, and complete."
The A.V. Club,83,"It's magnificent at times, but it's also complicated and sometimes unfocused."
Entertainment Weekly,83,"One gets the feeling that it's not this guy's love she's after. She's just using him for the breakup songs. This time around, it's getting harder to feel sorry for Swift."
Sputnikmusic,80,"Hearing Taylor Swift sing makes you remember these things, how you can wax poetic one day about the efficacy of love to change lives permanently for the better, and the next rail about how love leads only to pain and heartache."
AllMusic,80,"She's constructed something so precise its success seems preordained, but underneath it all, Taylor is still twitchy, which makes Red not just catchy but compelling."
American Songwriter,80,"If you're at a different stage of life than she is, it can be exhausting trying to keep up with the succession of emotions to which she deftly gives voice, but also downright exhilarating."
Spin,80,"Whatever it is, this music is full of adult pleasures."
The Observer (UK),80,"As ever, Swift seems to know just the right phrase to pull you inside her break-up narratives."
The Guardian,80,Swift has a knack for romance.
Los Angeles Times,75,"Red is a big record that reaches for Importance and occasionally touches it, filled with well-constructed pop songs Taylor-made for bedroom duets."
musicOMH.com,70,"Taken individually, most of the songs are accomplished and engaging (though we could certainly have done without the dreary Sad Beautiful Tragic) but Speak Now was such a coherent work that Red can't help but feel modestly disappointing."
Drowned In Sound,70,"For all its manufactured essence, Red remains firmly grounded at the crossroads between innocence and experience."
Consequence,70,"Money and success can be just as good a fable as Romeo and Juliet, and Swift is deft enough to make a point of and poke fun at her fairytale stardom."
Country Weekly,70,"Red may not be a bona fide country album, but it could very well be a pop masterpiece, more in line with P!nk's latest, The Truth About Love, than even Red's predecessor, Speak Now."
BBC Music,70,She's a quick-witted lyricist with a sharp eye.
Boston Globe,70,"It's not Bob Dylan, but the songwriting is leagues ahead of where Swift was as recently as two years ago."
Rolling Stone,70,"Whether she's real-talking Jake Gyllenhaal (""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"") or fantasizing about crashing ""a yacht-club party"" ... her self-discovery project is one of the best stories in pop. When she's really on, her songs are like tattoos."
PopMatters,60,"More varied in its offerings, but also more disjointed than her previous work, Red sounds like a transitional album for Swift."
Slant Magazine,60,"If Red is ultimately too uneven to be a truly great pop album, its highlights are career-best work for Swift, who now sounds like the pop star she was destined to be all along."
The Telegraph (UK),60,"It's frustrating, then, when Swift reverts back to type. Too many of the songs on this bloated 16-track album revisit the gently strummed verses and characterless choruses of her previous work."
Sputnikmusic,40,"As it stands for now though, Red is a mixed bag, and it's up to you to sort through the majority-holding bad in order to find the good."
