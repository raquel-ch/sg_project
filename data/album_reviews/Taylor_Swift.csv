Country Weekly,70,"Taylor wrote or co-wrote everything here herself (including the hit “Tim McGraw”), and while the most immediately striking songs are her eviscerations of no-good teenage boys (“Should’ve Said No,” “Picture to Burn”), the more thoughtful material suggests a talent poised to last well past high school."
AllMusic,70,"Swift's young age may be a major point of interest in bringing listeners in, but by the end of the record she's succeeded in keeping them."
Pitchfork,67,"A solid, spunky-yet-reflective country record told squarely from the teenage perspective."
Source Not Found,60,"Swift came out of the gate sounding bright-eyed but remarkably seasoned. [December 5, 2012]"
PopMatters,60,"At 16, Taylor Swift already seems too mature to be considered a child. It's to be hoped that when she finds both her place and her full grown voice, she's able to find an accomodation between the country tradition and her very obvious pop sensibilities, because Taylor Swift suggests she has much to offer."
