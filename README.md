Feedback video class Project Part A:

- thresholding for the network: we need to make sure that it doesnt look like a similarity matrix
- extra data: critics reviews. There are papers studying if the new albums are worst than the old ones. Goal: to check this
- how do the albums interact in the network?
- not necessarily the albums form communities. Investigate this

- choose attributes for each node:
    - release date
    - genre
    - album
    - spotify streams
